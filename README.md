This project uses a custom SVG map of Portugal‚Äôs municipalities for interactive selection. Here‚Äôs how the map was created from open data.

1. üîΩ Download the GeoJSON

We used the Opendatasoft platform to get a full GeoJSON of Portuguese municipalities:
	‚Ä¢	Dataset name: contornos-geograficos-dos-concelhos
	‚Ä¢	Format: GeoJSON
	‚Ä¢	Size: ~32MB

You can also access it via the Opendatasoft API if needed.

‚∏ª

2. üõ† Install Mapshaper (CLI)

To simplify the map and convert it to an SVG, install Mapshaper via npm:

npm install -g mapshaper



‚∏ª

3. ‚úÇÔ∏è Simplify and Export to SVG

We used the following command to:
	‚Ä¢	Simplify geometry (90% reduction)
	‚Ä¢	Set municipality names as path IDs
	‚Ä¢	Output clean, individual SVG paths

mapshaper portugal.geojson \
  -simplify 10% keep-shapes \
  -each 'id=con_name' \
  -o format=svg id-field=id combine-layers

	‚Ä¢	con_name is the name field for each municipality
	‚Ä¢	Each <path> in the output SVG has a unique id="MunicipalityName"

‚∏ª

4. ‚úÖ Output

The final portugal.svg file:
	‚Ä¢	Contains one <path> per municipality
	‚Ä¢	Uses id attributes for selection logic
	‚Ä¢	Is embedded directly in index.html
